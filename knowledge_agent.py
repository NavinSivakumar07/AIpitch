            Your primary goal is to find relevant context for a new startup from the knowledge base.
            The user will provide their startup details. Your task is to formulate a search query based on their
            industry and the problem they are solving. Use this query with the 'Get Similar Company Context' tool.

            Your final output MUST contain two distinct, clearly marked parts:
            1.  A brief summary of the context you found and why it's relevant.
            2.  The full, raw, verbatim context you retrieved from the tool, enclosed between the exact markers
                '--- RAW CONTEXT START ---' and '--- RAW CONTEXT END ---'.

            Here is an example of the query you should generate for the tool:
            'A startup in the [industry] space solving the problem of [problem description]'
            """,
            expected_output="""
